## An Android application

#### [the Project Scope File contains the scope of Gestation 3D](https://github.com/humayuntanwar/TemplateUI/blob/master/ScopeTemplateV4.0%20original.pdf)

### Tools and Technologies Used 

- Andriod Studio ( for application Development )
- Unity 3D ( For Augmented, Virtual Reality and 3D Modelling )
- Vuforia Sdk ( Augmented Reality)
- Firebase Database ( User a and Location Management)
- SQLite ( for serving offline data)
- Google Maps Api (Displaying User Location and Hospitals Locations)
- Google Cardbox ( For VR )

### Scope 
```
A user will download Gestation 3D from app store. He/she will make his/her profile in the
application. Then the user will be taken through an overview of the application and described all 
the features of Gestation 3D and how they can be used. Using Gestation 3D, the user will be
given a textual introduction to gestation period in 2D using simple images and text. In the next
step, user can view baby’s development that is divided into different stages and at each stage user
can view the guide about ideal diets and exercises at each stage. In the next step, the user can view
the whole gestation process in 3D using virtual reality. Furthermore, the process of handling the
baby can be viewed by the user in augmented reality. Using the baby as the marker, the user can
view options on how to handle baby in situation like feeding, carrying and lying down. After
learning about the process, user can also take a quiz about the gestation period as well as the
handling of the baby. This way he can evaluate his knowledge on the subject. Now if the user is a
pregnant woman and in an unknown place or city, she can get locations of the nearby hospitals in
case an emergency situation arises. 
```

 ### System Limitations/Constraints
 ```
It will only act as a guidance and will not completely replace the doctor. The diets and exercises
described in the software are for the ideal conditions. Gestation 3D will require internet
connection and would require the user to be logged in. The baby development shown in
Gestation 3D are only for ideal conditions and does not take into account women’s physical,
psychological or environmental factor. Gestation 3D does not show the development of twin
babies. The augmented reality handling of the baby can only be done through the available
functions of Gestation 3D. The location of the nearby hospitals depends on how accurately
the user’s position is detected through the phone’s GPS.
